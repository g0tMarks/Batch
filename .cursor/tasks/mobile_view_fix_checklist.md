# Mobile View Fix Checklist

## 1. General Layout & Responsiveness
- [ ] Add or update viewport meta tag in all HTML files:  
  `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
- [ ] Test all pages on screen widths between 320px and 480px.
- [ ] Remove any horizontal scrolling; ensure only vertical scrolling is possible.

## 2. Typography
- [ ] Adjust font sizes for headings, subheadings, and body text to be readable on mobile.
- [ ] Ensure all text wraps within the screen and does not overflow or get cut off.
- [ ] Use CSS media queries to set appropriate font sizes for mobile devices.

## 3. Buttons & Navigation
- [ ] Make sure all buttons (e.g., LOGIN, SIGN UP) are at least 44x44px in size.
- [ ] Add enough space (margin/padding) between buttons and other interactive elements.
- [ ] Check that navigation is always accessible (consider a hamburger menu if needed).

## 4. Content Blocks
- [ ] Check that all text is fully visible (no cut-off sentences).
- [ ] Add padding and margin between different content sections for clarity.
- [ ] Avoid large empty spaces or sections that look cramped.

## 5. Branding & Visuals
- [ ] Make sure brand fonts and colors are still used, but are legible on small screens.
- [ ] Ensure images and icons scale down or hide gracefully on mobile.
- [ ] Test that all icons and images look sharp and are not blurry.

## 6. Performance
- [ ] Optimize images for web (use compressed formats like .webp or .jpg).
- [ ] Remove or defer loading of any unnecessary large assets/scripts on mobile.

## 7. Accessibility
- [ ] Ensure all buttons and links are accessible via keyboard (tab navigation).
- [ ] Add `aria-labels` or descriptive text for all interactive elements.
- [ ] Test with a screen reader to make sure content is accessible.

## 8. Cross-browser Testing
- [ ] Test the mobile view on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge browsers.
- [ ] Fix any layout or functionality issues that appear in any browser.

## 9. QA & Validation
- [ ] Take before/after screenshots of each page on a mobile device.
- [ ] Ask at least 3 people to test the mobile view on their phones and collect feedback.
- [ ] Make any final adjustments based on feedback.
